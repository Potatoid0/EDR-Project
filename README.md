# EDR-Project

This is *(or will be)* a very simplistic Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) project for myself to become more familiar with:
- C/C++
- Windows Internals and API Calls
- Security Concepts and Best Practices
- Event Monitoring and Analysis
- Memory Efficiency, Use, and Optimizations
- Network Traffic Analysis
- Malware Behavior and Detection Methods
- etc

**Note:** This project is being developed *exclusively* as a learning experience, it should in no way be relied on for actual security events or protection from malicious activities.
